# Brief

Cloud dashboard was the placeholder name for the project. We were working on this project to integrate all clouds on one dashboard for cloud admins. The clients we were building for internally had many users who used to interact with multiple cloud interfaces to provide services, which wasnâ€™t scalable. They wanted to build a dashboard and all APIs underneath would communicate with all cloud providers. This would save them time in training and scaling the operations. I was responsible for building the project from scratch, built it using Next.js (Client side) + Node.js (server side) + Mongodb (DB for storing the preferences from each cloud provider as backup).
