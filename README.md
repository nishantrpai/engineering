# Overview

Have been working professionally since 2016, was doing side-projects from 2012 (not present in this document).

This repository is to consolidate all of my technical work:

1. What the hardest problems in those projects were. 

2. How I accomplished them? 

3. What lessons can be applied from these to future projects?
