# Brief

Jobility is building a platform for connecting daily wage workers with companies who are looking for a day or two of work. They have two web apps, one is for the workers and one is for the companies. One is an admin dashboard with which they can monitor all the workers, the companies, the ongoing work and so on and so forth. I was working on the dashboard part and was the only dev responsible for building the entire webapp from scratch.
