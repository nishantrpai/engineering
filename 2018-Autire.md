# Brief

Autire is a webapp for auditors to manage their auditing across a company. I was working on the dashboard page where we made tools like department audits and APIâ€™s for handling audits across same people of different department and so on so forth.  

Stack: React.js + Node.js

## Problem
Consuming API was the difficult part, was undocumented and there were over 20-30 variables which had to be nested

## Solution
1. Documented the keys and mapped, was the only solution to solve this problem. Rest of the problems were connecting the API, updating the frontend and sending data from frontend to the backend.
