[Project Link](https://nthgarden.netlify.app)

Digital gardens are a way for sharing your second brain. Can read more about it [here](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up).

This project is focused more on integrating multiple services, very little technical/engineering work was done here.

The key thing in this project was integration with git and netlify. Once the git repo was updated, the changes would be reflected on the app.
