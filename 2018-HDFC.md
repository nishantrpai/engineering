# Brief

So HDFC life is an insurance provider and they were looking into a way to provide their customers with a quote for insurance, based on a few questions designed by their team. There were multiple layouts based on question and each question had its particular configuration using Reactjs. Used AWS Lex API’s in the backend with node.js for maintaining the state of the flow. 

Since editing and adding questions in the backend and lex was a real pain for the HDFC guys and since there were many question types, we designed for them a custom tool using which they could design convoluted flows and view them in a graph and editing/adding questions would automatically update the database as well as get updated/added in the aws lex bot using the lex model api’s.
