# Brief

Ninjavan is working on making a CMS system for e-commerce websites with reactjs. Currently they made a website with their existing component library in react, an ecommerce website called kjustore.com and wanted to replicate their logic of rendering using api in other ecommerce websites as well, so we were designing components to handle such logic for them in reactjs.
