# Brief

Rayo is a CRM for real estate agents, it is used for booking an appointment with agents. The web app components were built on antd (a react library). They were having trouble with the components and API integration, I did that for them in a week's time with multiple changes in the codebase to make it more scalable.

Stack: React.js

## Problem

Ensuring consistency of font sizes

## Solution

- Seems to be a trivial problem, but there were certain brand guidelines to follow.

- For eg; need to make sure `h1` was of a certain height across the app

- Luckily, we were using SCSS so this problem was solved using global variables

```
$base-color: #c6538c;
$border-dark: rgba($base-color, 0.88);

.alert {
  border: 1px solid $border-dark;
}
```

## Problem

Checking the availability 


## Problem

Hot reload

## Solution

Hot reload, is refreshing the website when you make changes on the website while maintaining the current values and state

1. `react-hot-loader` was the package I used to solve this problem 

2. Was a very handy addition, because everytime anyone wrote any updates we would have to refresh (i.e., mount all components) and we would lose all
